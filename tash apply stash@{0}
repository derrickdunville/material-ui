stash@{0}: WIP on master: 62ae3c7 Moved admin route to same path depth as app, so far the layout is close, still a couple issues. When traversing to the second level of account, the app bar/page title appears to flicker as the slideLeft2 animation is completing. Still would like to figure out how to embed a CSSTransiion within a CSSTransition in a child route. The CSSTransition HOC as a lower path depth recieves location props when the pathname changes causeing a higher level CSSTransition to be rerendered causeing issues with the sideBar to disappear on the next route change.
